# AI Python Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small to medium-sized projects focused on exploring various applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) using Python and related technologies.

## Projects

Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

### 1. AI Agent Research (`AI_agent_research/`)

*   **Description:** A research assistant agent built with LangChain. It takes a user query, utilizes tools like web search (Tavily) and Wikipedia, and generates a research summary with sources. It supports different LLMs (Claude, GPT) and saves the output.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, LangChain, Langchain-OpenAI, Langchain-Anthropic, Tavily Search, Wikipedia, Pydantic.

### 2. AI Agent Voice Assistant (`AI_agent_voice_assistant/`)

*   **Description:** A demonstration of a Voice AI agent capable of handling voice calls. It features a simple backend API for tasks like order retrieval and integrates with Vapi.ai for voice functionality.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, Flask (Backend), React, Vite, @vapi-ai/web (Frontend).

### 3. AI Coding Mentor (`AI_coding_mentor/`)

*   **Description:** An interactive AI-powered learning platform designed to help users master coding concepts. It offers structured learning roadmaps, interactive quizzes, a searchable resource library (using vector search), and an AI chat assistant integrated via the Parlant platform.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, Streamlit, MongoDB, Pymongo, Sentence Transformers, Pydantic, Parlant SDK.

### 4. AI Scraper Agent (`AI_scraper_agent/`)

*   **Description:** An AI agent designed to scrape web data, specifically demonstrated by extracting the latest posts from a specified Instagram profile using browser automation.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, Langchain-Anthropic, browser-use (Playwright), Pydantic.

### 5. AI Voice Assistant (`AI_voice_assistant/`)

*   **Description:** A general-purpose AI voice assistant application. It includes a backend for real-time audio processing, speech-to-text, and natural language understanding (using OpenAI), and a frontend for user interaction.
*   **Key Technologies:** Python, Flask (Backend), OpenAI API, React, Vite (Frontend).
